 Get ExtJS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install graphite, you will first need to download the ExtJS SDK from
http://www.extjs.com/. Extract it somewhere and it will create an ext-VERSION/
subdir.


 Run install.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the install script like so:

python install.py --extjs=/path/to/ext-VERSION

This will check for graphite's runtime dependencies and let
you know which you are missing. Download and install these modules and re-run
install.py until it detects all the required modules.

Graphite requires:
 python2.4 or greater
 pycairo (with PNG backend support)
 mod_python
 django
 python-ldap (optional - needed for ldap-based webapp authentication)
 python-memcached (optional - needed for webapp caching, big performance boost)
 python-sqlite2 (optional - a django-supported database module is required)

Once install.py has completed, graphite will be installed in
/usr/local/graphite (unless you specified --install-root). It will also
create a "graphite-vhost.conf" file in the current directory. You can use
this to configure apache.


 Apache Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, Apache has to have mod_python configured, this is usually done
by including a line like the following in your httpd.conf:

LoadModule python_module    modules/mod_python.so

Second you should configure a vhost for graphite (technically it doesn't have
to be a vhost but its good practice). This can be done one of two ways.

The first way (highly preferred) is to include independent vhost configs.

# This goes in httpd.conf
Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/vhosts.d/*.conf

Then simply drop the graphite-vhost.conf file that install.py created
into the vhosts.d/ directory (or whatever directory your system uses) and
you're all set.

The second approach is to copy the contents of the graphite-vhost.conf file
and insert it down at the end of your httpd.conf.

Restart apache and you should see the graphite webapp on the main page.
If you encounter problems, you can increase the verbosity of error output
by adding a "DEBUG = True" line to /usr/local/graphite/web/local_settings.py
